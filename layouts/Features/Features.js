            We work with Congress, Federal agencies, and partners on policy
            issues and legislation to ensure funding for trails, preservation of
            natural areas, and protection of the hiking experience.

            Trails don't maintain themselves. Individuals of any age and
            experience level can become trail stewards. Give back to the trails you
            love, meet new people, and enjoy the experience!
